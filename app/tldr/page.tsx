            After getting straight A's and pre-med requirements to become a Psychiatrist I realized that wasn't for me.
            I took a few years and taught myself how to program, and fell in love with the challenge.

            In order to get my foot in the door I took a junior position at a trading company startup.
            Quickly I rose to be one of the best performing juniors.
          </P>
          <P>
            My next opportunity was a Food Service startup where I started by porting over old javascript code to typescript. I picked up on the company's patterns and with my newly strengthened typescript skills I found myself in a teacher/mentor role, which I loved.
          </P>
          <P>
            I took a position working for a bond marketing platform within a year I was offered a promotion, and when the company began to expand I was promoted to Team Lead.
            I was in charge of managing the "Core" Epic, which encompased a variety of projects and routine maintenance on the site.
            Before long I was spear-heading month long features managing a team of five.
