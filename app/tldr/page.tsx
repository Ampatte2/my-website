                  After getting straight A's and pre-med requirements to become a Psychiatrist I realized that wasn't for me.
                  I took a few years and taught myself how to program, and fell in love with the challenge.

                  In order to get my foot in the door I took a junior position at a startup that was developing a trading application based on Solidity with Svelte.

                  The latest opportunity was a startup that serviced the municipal bond sector, and within a year I was offered a promotion to keep my talent on the team. When the company began to expand I was promoted to a Team Lead.
                  I was in charge of managing the "Core" Epic, which encompased a variety of projects and routine maintenance on the site.
                  Before long I was spear-heading month long features managing a team of five.

The <strong>best</strong> problems come from working on embedded systems. Having the physical component cost of "just trying it out" forces you to become creative and try different solutions</P>

Navigating files, moving around inside files, text manipulation, and infinite customization. I realized that they were able to iterate significantly faster than I was using vanilla VSCode.</P>
