          After getting straight A's and pre-med requirements to become a Psychiatrist I realized that wasn't for me.
          I took a few years and taught myself how to program, and fell in love with the challenges.
          In order to get my foot in the door I took a junior position at a trading company startup.
        </P>
        <P>
          Quickly I rose to be one of the best performing juniors, but the company did not secure additional funding.
          My next opportunity arose at a Food Service startup within a year I was offered a promotion and a raise, and when the company began to expand I was promoted to Team Lead.
          I was in charge of managing the "Core" Epic, which encompased a variety of projects and routine maintenance on the site.
          Before long I was spear-heading month long features managing a team of five.
