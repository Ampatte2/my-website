                    I have always wanted to help people and I thought my passion was psychiatry. However, after getting straight A's in pre-med classes I realized that wasn't for me. People are challenging, but I determined that people themselves are the only ones who can fix themselves.
                  </P>
                  <P>After coming to that conclusion one of my close friends who I used to game with told me about his new job coding</P>
                  <P>
                    This was finally what I was seeking: a technical profession that would always have new and interesting challenges. So, I taught myself how to code and the basic principles of web development and started looking for my foot in the door. What I found was a junior position at a startup that was developing a trading application, and I quickly I rose to be one of the best performing juniors.
                  </P>
                  <P>
                    My next opportunity was a Food Service startup where one of my first tasks was to convert the entire code-base from Javascript to Typescript. By the end of my employment I had arisen to be teacher/mentor role.
                  </P>
                  <P>
                    The latest opportunity was a Municipal Bond startup, and again within a year I was offered a promotion and increased responsibilities. Then when the company began to grow I was promoted to a Team Lead.
                  </P>
                  <P>
                    I was put in charge of managing the Core Epic which serviced the maintenance, bug fixes, and small feature requests.

            <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 mb-16">
              <P>As a junior paired with a developer on my team who used Emacs, and the level of control they had over their editor astounded me. Navigating between files, moving around inside files, text manipulation, and infinite customization. It was clear to me that they were able to iterate significantly faster than I was using vanilla VS Code.</P>
              <P>It wasn't Emacs or Vim that made them efficient, it was their level experience with their editor and their equipment.</P>
              <P>So, since Vim is the lowest common denominator of editors I took the next 6 months learning Vim (Neovim flavor) and a QMK programmable keyboard.</P>

                <P>I've endured the pain of endless configuration files to make "my" operating system. Even a few mistakes along the way, like realizing that I needed to update the location of vmlinuz in the config. Even though my UEFI system recognizes the install location of EFI/boot/bootx86.efi, the OS is looking in /BOOT. </P>
                <P>Then add in a little unassuming "sudo pacman -Syu", restart, and get stuck at the GRUB bootloader... time to break out the ISO and start seeing where I went wrong.</P>
                <P>Definitely was a skill issue though.</P>
              </div>
              <P>Both OS and side project Arch linux has taught me that at the end of the day regardless of what you're working on in software it is always:</P>

            </div>
            <P>Another team member showed me the customizations that the keyboard firmware QMK could provide, and the beauty that is <strong>Layers</strong>.</P>
            <P>Then it got creative, I started experimenting with different seats, different desks, sitting on the ground, sitting on a ball chair, and all gave me issues when trying to code for long stretches (10+ hours).</P>
            <P>After a couple iterations I thought to myself "What is the most comfortable chair?" A zero gravity recliner of course! Then it all came together with my lounge chair, split keyboard, and a PVC frame for the monitor to keep it at a good distance above my head.</P>
            <P>Next iteration will remove the PVC with a more permanent, and a better way to get in and out. Right now I kind of slink out to the side.</P>
