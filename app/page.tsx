                  After getting straight A's and pre-med requirements to become a Psychiatrist I realized that wasn't for me.
                  I took a few years and taught myself how to program, and fell in love with the challenge.

                <P>
                  My next opportunity was a Food Service startup where one of my first tasks was to convert the codebase from Javascript to Typescript. By the end of my employment I had arisen to be teacher/mentor role.
                </P>
                <P>
                  The latest opportunity was a Municipal Bond startup, and within a year I was offered a promotion to keep my talent on the team. When the company began to expand I was promoted to a Team Lead.
                </P>
                <P>
                  I was in charge of managing the "Core" Epic, which encompased a variety of projects and routine maintenance on the site.

Navigating files, moving around inside files, text manipulation, and infinite customization. I realized that they were able to iterate significantly faster than I was using vanilla VSCode.</P>
              <P>I spent the next 6 months learning a new keyboard and Vim (Neovim flavor), and it was well worth every second. The choice of Vim has been great, my editor comes standard on every machine, and now I can be the one to impress the juniors.</P>

Hit that "sudo pacman -Syu", restart, and get stuck at the GRUB bootloader... then dejectedly breaking out the ER tools (Arch Linux ISO) and start seeing where I went wrong.</P>

              <P>Then it kind of spiraled from there, I started expirementing with different seats, different desks, sitting on the ground, sitting on a ball chair, and all gave me issues when trying to code for long stretches (10+ hours).</P>
              <P>After a couple iterations I thought to myself: What is the most comfortable chair? A zero gravity recliner of course! Then I just kind of put it all together my lounge chair, split keyboard, and a PVC frame for the monitor to keep it at a good distance above my head.</P>
              <P>Next iteration will remove the PVC with a better material, and a better way to get in and out. Right now I kind of slink out to the side.</P>
